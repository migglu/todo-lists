# To-Do lists

This is the project I do while reading the book [Test-Driver Development with Python](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754) to try and learn Django.

The commits in this project will not follow the commits in the book, as I'm already proficient with git. This repo is here only so it can be accessed from multiple places.
